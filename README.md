## Ghosts and Loot

This is my submission to the [Kenney Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/kenney-jam-2023) game jam.  The rules limited the art assets to those made by [Kenney](https://www.kenney.nl/).

The idea grew organically while trying to prototype something that fit the theme.  I had hoped to make the flashlight dim over time so the player had to collect batteries.  I also wanted to do health pickups, random building spawns, and loot chests.  I ran out of time for all of this, but am satisfied with the state it was submitted in.
